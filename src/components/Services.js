              go to Virginia Tech this scholarship so they too can be given a

              The application process involves both TCVT Officers and Sponsors
              to determine which applicant is best suited for such a

              TCVT ADOPTS A HIGHWAY!
            </h1>
            <p className="text-white">
              TCVT has joined the Adopt A Highway program in the state of
              Virginia! The organization has officially adopted Route 460 from
              Southgate to Tom's Creek in Montgomery County totaling 3.0 miles.
              By adopting this section of highway, TCVT agrees to keep it
              cleared of litter for a three-year period by performing at least
              two successful pickups in one calendar year. We, of course, intend
              to perform more pickups.

              THE BUBBY INITIATIVE
            </h1>
            <p className="text-white">
              This initiative was started by Sebastian Buenano who was a founder
              and is the current President of Truck Club at Virginia Tech. The
              initiative is named after Sebastian's best friend who was a welsh
              corgi named Bubby. The impact that one special corgi left on
              Sebastian will last with him till the day they meet again. In
              honor of this friendship and the lasting memory of Bubby, TCVT is
              promising to help a local animal shelter every April! We hope that
              our efforts can support and assist in the start of a new
              friendship between a loving animal and a caring human being just
              like the one Sebastian had with Bubby.

              TOYS FOR TOTS INITIATIVE
            </h1>
            <p className="text-white">
              This year Truck Club at Virginia Tech (TCVT) partnered with Toys
              For Tots in the effort to provide underprivileged kids with gifts
              this Christmas season. We accepted donations up to December 11th.
              All donations were given to Toys for Tots. We want to thank the
              local Marine Corps League for collecting the toys! Any little bit
              that was given was greatly appreciated. TCVT raised over $500 and
              bought/collected over 150 new, unwrapped toys! This could not have
              been done without some incredible people and local businesses. We
              want to thank Leonard on S Main St. in Blacksburg, VA for hosting
              our last truck meet which was meant to raise funds and collect
              toys for the Toys For Tots Initiative. We also want to thank 5
              Star Nutrition in Blacksburg, VA for supporting our cause. Thank
              you to Mission BBQ and BAMBAM for catering at our event! Every
              donation and gift that was received was greatly appreciated. Thank
              you all for your support and we are glad that a lot of kids will
              have a lot of awesome toys this Christmas season!
